                    Puppies are soft, cute, funny, and make a big mess. Every month 
                    or two our family fosters 6-12 week old puppies for a puppy rescue
                    nonprofit organization. We all enjoy cuddling their furry bodies 
                    after a clean bath. Fresh puppy smell is great. The puppies play
                    with each other and our adult dog. They look so funny when they 
                    lay on top of each other and sleep. While puppies can be great 
                    fun, they also can make big messes. 4-6 puppies can make a lot 
                    of puppy pee and poop. It's a challenge to keep the puppies and
                    the puppy pen clean.
